# Welcome to my customer segmentation project!

## Introduction
As business grows, company will have larger customer base with various characteristic. By segmenting our customer, we can create more effective marketing strategies and better use of limited marketing budget.
In this project, I use dataset from UCI https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail+II. The dataset contains transaction data of a UK-based online retail between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011. Behavioral segmentation will be used for this project.
Method that I use for behavioral segmentation is Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) method. Customer Lifetime Value for a firm is the net profit/loss to the firm from a customer over the entire life of transactions of that customer with the firm (Jain & Singh, 2002).

## Goal & Algorithm
* Prepare data with Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) method
* Find optimum number of segment with K-Means Clustering
* Propose customer loyalty program based on clustering result

## Result
From K-Means Clustering, the best number of cluster (k) is 4. Characteristics for each cluster and its loyalty program proposal can be read in the .ipnyb notebook. In this project, We can reduce marketing cost up to USD 2,322 or 56% by using customer segmentation.
